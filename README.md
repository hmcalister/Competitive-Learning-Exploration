# Competitive Learning Exploration

An exploration of some competitive learning algorithms, with a goal to implement these techniques into [Clustering with Associative Memories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03209).

The techniques focused on here are:
- [Frequency Sensitive Competitive Learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/089360809090071R)
- [Rival Penalized Competitive Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/238318/)
- [Kohonen's Self-Organizing Map](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00337288)
- [Growing Neural Gas](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/1994/hash/d56b9fc4b0f1be8871f5e1c40c0067e7-Abstract.html)

All of which are implemented in clustering techniques to find data representations.
